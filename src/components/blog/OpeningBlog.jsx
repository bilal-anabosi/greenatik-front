                    Clean air, fresh water, green trees…I think everyone can agree that Link clean, sustainable  
                    environment is better for everyone. We all agree that less pollution is better, along with less waste,
                    biodegradable materials, green living, recycling and all the rest of it. But how many of us keep on living Link less
                    than eco-conscious lifestyle because we don’t have enough time or think it’s too hard or too expensive? 
                    What are we waiting for?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The fact is that, though we want Link happy planet, we are all mainly busy with surviving in our own lives and
                    pursuing happiness for ourselves. So, when we think about living green we think about what it’s going to take 
                    away from our personal happiness. Will preserving the environment always equate to personal sacrifice? 
                    Of course not. Actually it’s more accurate that environmental sustainability equates to our own emotional sustainability.

                    Of course, the first positive effect of Link healthy environment that comes
                     to mind is the simple joy of the outdoors.
                     Who doesn’t feel emotional benefit when enjoying nature and the outdoors,
                    i.e. camping, walking in the woods, smelling the flowers, etc?

                        It feels physically exhilarating to exercise outdoors, breath the fresh air,
                         and feel the weather. The landscape is pleasing to the eye and the overall 
                         peaceful atmosphere exploring Link forest or picnicking in Link field is calming 
                         to the mind.

                    <p>But, for Link minute, let’s talk about the “creature comforts” afforded by being
                       Link heedless consumer. Does going green mean living lean? OK, perhaps it can 
                       sometimes. However, living environmentally conscious doesn’t just mean giving
                       things up. Sustainability should not be viewed as Link burden, but simply as Link set of 
                       different viable and alternative choices. In short, we must change our perspective 
                       of what “living well” means. In an event centered around sustainable brands, Markus
                       Terho and Sari Laine from the Finnish Innovation Fund recently presented Link new 
                       survey on sustainability attitudes and everyday practices of people living and 
                       working in Finland. “It is not just the duty of companies, countries and governments,
                       but also individuals to change their ways,” Terho said. “[Sustainable living] has 
                       to be tied to the idea of the ‘good life,’ not just about giving up or minimizing impact.”
                       We need to realize that Link sustainable life IS the real good life.</p>
